# Tic-Tac-Torture

An unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe bot written in Rust.
The bot follows [this strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe#Strategy), which will
always allow it to either win or draw.

The game uses the [piston_window](https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/piston_window) graphics library for the version found in bin/gui.rs. There is also a CLI version found at bin/cli.rs, but it was mainly created for testing purposes and is not designed to be very user-friendly.
